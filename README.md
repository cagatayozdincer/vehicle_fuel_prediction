# 🚗 Vehicle Fuel Consumption Prediction

This project aims to predict the average fuel consumption based on the technical specifications of different vehicles. In this machine learning application developed with Python, data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and different regression models have been used to compare the results.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is located in the `arac_verileri.csv` file and contains the following variables:

- `brand_model`: Vehicle brand and model  
- `cylinder`: Number of cylinders  
- `hp`: Horsepower  
- `weight`: Weight (kg)  
- `acceleration`: 0-100 km/h acceleration time  
- `model_year`: Vehicle production year  
- `target`: Average fuel consumption (L/100 km)

**Note:** The data has been artificially generated by the user.
